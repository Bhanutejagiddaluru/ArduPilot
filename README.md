### Step 2: Using the DroneCAN GUI Tool

#### Flashing Steps
1. Open the **DroneCAN GUI Tool** after installation.

2. **Connect the Module:**
   - Connect the DroneCAN module to your PC using a USB-CAN adapter.
   - Ensure proper wiring and power supply.

3. **Set Up Local Node ID:**
   - Open the GUI tool interface and **uncheck** the "Set local node ID" box.
   - Verify connected nodes in the **Online Nodes** section.

4. **Flash the Firmware:**
   - Select your connected node from the list.
   - Click **Update Firmware** and choose the **`AP_Periph.bin`** file downloaded earlier.

### Step 3: Configuring the DroneCAN Module in Pixhawk

After updating the DroneCAN module, configure the Pixhawk flight controller to recognize and utilize the module.

#### Parameters in Flight Controller
Set the following parameters in **Mission Planner** or **QGroundControl**:

| **Parameter**          | **Value** |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| `CAN_D1_PROTOCOL`       | 1         |
| `CAN_P1_DRIVER`         | 1         |
| `CAN_D1_UC_ESC_OF`      | 4         |
| `CAN_D1_UC_ESC_BM`      | Select appropriate values |
| `CAN_D1_UC_SRV_BM`      | Select Servo 13 and Servo 14 |
| `BRD_SAFETYENABLE`      | 0         |

#### How to Select Servos
- Use the **`CAN_D1_UC_SRV_BM`** parameter to enable **Servo 13** and **Servo 14**.
- Refer to the image below for setting the parameters:
